# Group 34 Calculator

Are you think kind of person who hates doing math in your head and always wants to double check your answer? If so, the Group 34 Calculator is perfect for you! Our simple calculator performs all the necessary basic functions of a calculator such as adding, subtracting, dividing, and multiplying. The Group 34 Calculator is written entirely in Java. In the future we hope to add more functions to it and expand it past a basic calulator.

## Installation

Installation is simple. First install [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) and set [JAVA_HOME](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/), then install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). After that build the project and then you can begin using the Group 34 Calculator.

## How to Use

To use the calculator run the project and follow the prompts. Here is an example of running the Group 34 Calculator:

```console
$ java -jar target/cs510-homework-1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
The first number is: 
40
Number 1 is 40.0
Enter operator: +, -, * or /
+
The second number is:
10
Number 2 is 10.0
Result is: 50.0
Continue? Y/N
```

After each calculation you can enter `Y` to run another calulation or `N` to quit.
